"""First Principles Code engineering library.

Each module in this package holds one class for one engineering domain. Import
the class you need, create an instance, and call its methods::

    from library.dynamics import Dynamics
    from library.statics import Statics

    dyn = Dynamics()
    x = dyn.displacement_constant_acceleration(
        initial_position=0.0, initial_velocity=5.0,
        acceleration=9.81, time=3.0,
    )

The classes are intentionally lightweight (no shared state) so that each method
reads as a self-contained, well-documented worked example.

# Re-export the domain classes so callers can also write
# ``from library import Dynamics``. Keeping this list in one place documents
# everything the library currently offers.
