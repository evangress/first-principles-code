"""controls.py - feedback control calculations (P, PD, PID).

Control theory keeps systems on target despite disturbances. These helpers
compute a PID controller's output, characterise a second-order system's
response (natural frequency, damping, overshoot), and simulate a closed loop
so you can watch a controller settle - the kind of thing you would otherwise do
in MATLAB's Control System Toolbox or Simulink.
