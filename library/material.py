"""material.py - material science and strength of materials.

This class covers how materials deform and fail under load: Hooke's law, the
stress-strain relationship, beam bending, thermal expansion, and column
buckling. These are the calculations that decide whether a part is stiff
enough, strong enough, and stable enough.
