"""statics.py - equilibrium and load analysis for bodies at rest.

Statics is dynamics with everything standing still: the sum of forces and the
sum of moments are both zero. These helpers cover the calculations that show up
constantly in structural and machine design - reactions, moments, stress, and
friction.
