"""utility.py - cross-cutting helper methods.

The Utility class collects the "plumbing" every engineering script needs but
that does not belong to any single physics domain: reading and writing JSON,
exporting results to CSV (so you can open them in a spreadsheet), and popping up
a native file-picker dialog with tkinter.

These methods demonstrate working with the file system, the ``json`` and
``csv`` standard-library modules, and optional GUI dialogs that degrade
gracefully when no display is available (e.g. on a server).
