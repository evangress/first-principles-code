"""main.py - First Principles Code: displacement from acceleration & velocity.

This script is the "hello world" of engineering kinematics. It answers a
question every engineer meets early: *given how something accelerates, where
does it end up?*  We solve it three ways so you can see how Python replaces the
tools you might reach for in MATLAB or Maplesoft:

    1. The closed-form (analytical) equation of motion - pure ``math``.
    2. Numerical integration of a CONSTANT acceleration      - ``scipy``.
    3. Numerical integration of a TIME-VARYING acceleration  - ``scipy``.

The numerical approach is the payoff: once you can integrate a()->v()->x()
with code, you are no longer limited to problems that have a tidy formula.

Run it with:

    uv run main.py

    # that the numerical methods below should reproduce.

    # === 2. Numerical integration of constant acceleration ===============
    # The fundamental relationships are:  v(t) = integral(a dt),
    # and  x(t) = integral(v dt).  scipy can do both for us.
    #
    # Build a fine time grid from 0 to t_final. More points -> more accuracy.

    # the running integral; ``initial=0`` makes the array start at 0 so we can
    # add our real starting velocity v0 afterward.

    # The last element is the displacement at t_final.

    # === 3. Numerical integration of TIME-VARYING acceleration ===========
    # Real systems rarely have constant acceleration. Suppose a thruster adds
    # a sinusoidal acceleration on top of gravity:  a(t) = g + 2*sin(t).
    # There is no clean schoolbook formula, but code does not care.
    a_varying = g + 2.0 * np.sin(t)
    v_varying = v0 + integrate.cumulative_trapezoid(a_varying, t, initial=0.0)
    x_varying = x0 + integrate.cumulative_trapezoid(v_varying, t, initial=0.0)
    x_numeric_varying = x_varying[-1]

    # === 4. Same answer via our own library class ========================
